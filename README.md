# solid-course (Udemy)
This project implements the 5 principles of SOLID with examples.

With this is more easy to know and learn about each principle 

I added refactories to compare with and without the principles.

This project was made with: 

- NodeJS
- Typescript
- Sucrase
- Nodemon
- Express
